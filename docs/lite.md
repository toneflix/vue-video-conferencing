# Toneflix Vue Video Conferencing Lite

The lite version of the library is stripped down of the base dependencies, although it still offers the same functionality as the full version of the library, the lite version rather opts for the CDN version of the Jitsi Meet API instead of the third party NPM libraries used in the full version of the library making it a lot lighter and with less bloat.

## Installation

To install the lite version of the library, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm i vue-video-conference-lite
```
